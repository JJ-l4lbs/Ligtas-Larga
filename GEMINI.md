# Project: Integrated Development & Vibecoding Harness (Antigravity CLI Edition)

## 1. Core Engineering & Vibecoding Philosophy
# These overarching paradigms govern every interaction, code block generation, and architectural decision.

* **Surgical Precision Over Broad Rebuilds:** Code with tight intentionality. Always exhaustively investigate opportunities to modify localized, specific parts of the existing codebase before blindly attempting to rebuild or rewrite an entire script or structural asset.
* **Simple is Best (Relentless Simplicity):** Prioritize writing the cleanest, most efficient code and the best possible algorithms while keeping the simplicity of the code. Every single line of generated code must be continually cross-examined to avoid over-engineering.
* **Uncompromising User Security:** Prioritize user and system security above all else. Under no circumstances should security measures be lax, bypassed, or deferred. Secure coding patterns, strict authentication boundaries, and data safety protocols must be baked natively into every feature from line one.
* **More with Less (No Bloated Code):** Do not overcomplicate or bloat files into hundreds of lines. Prioritize modularizing logic into small, reusable, and easily manageable modules, helper functions, custom hooks, and components. Always verify that all the files are modularized or check that you have not accidentally introduced bloated code when implementing any specific instruction or function. Refer to Architecture.md to consult the line counts of all active files and audit for bloat. Note: This constraint applies to all application source and execution code (e.g., TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, TSX) and is not enforced for `.md` files or other meta-documentation assets.

## 2. Strict Workflow Constraints (The Architectural Cascade)
# Enforce an absolute operational split between conceptual planning and mechanical execution loops.
# The Head Project Manager Agent must process and validate the following file tree sequentially before writing any application code.

* **Step 1 - Project Initiation Document (`PID.md` Check):** Before taking any development action, verify that `PID.md` exists at the root of the project.
  * The `PID.md` file must be highly detailed and explicitly cover: Project Scope, Core Business/Product Objectives, Target Audience, MVP Feature List, Success Metrics, and High-Level Constraints.
  * **Hard Stop Condition:** If `PID.md` does not exist, halt immediately and output:
    > "Missing critical project foundation. Awaiting `PID.md`. Please answer the following questions so we can generate this context together:
    > 1. What is the core purpose and high-level goal of this application?
    > 2. Who is the target audience, and what primary problem does this solve for them?
    > 3. What is the absolute minimum viable product (MVP) feature list?
    > 4. Are there any specific business logic rules or external constraints I must respect?"

* **Step 2 - Design Specification Document (`Design.md` Check & Google Stitch Loop):** Verify that `Design.md` exists at the root of the project workspace.
  * The `Design.md` file must contain the following structural pillars: Targeted Design (planned layout frameworks and sample interfaces), Design Philosophy (core visual rules and UX themes), Typography (font pairings and scale hierarchies), and Interface Interactions (concrete behavioral blueprints).
  * **Hard Stop Condition & Stitch Integration:** If `Design.md` does not exist or lacks this context, halt execution and output:
    > "Awaiting design spec. I will now consult you about the specifics of the design. Once requirements are gathered, I will trigger the `/stitch` command to build your layout rules via the connected Google Stitch canvas. Afterward, I will export the generated `Design.md` back to this repository and append any of your specific design preferences before we proceed."

* **Step 3 - Architecture Blueprint Document (`Architecture.md` Check):** Verify that `Architecture.md` exists at the root. This document entirely replaces all inline environmental contexts.
  * The `Architecture.md` file must explicitly define: The Core Tech Stack, Target Database, Test Runners/Frameworks, Code Formatting/Linting configurations, and the complete System Architecture.
  * **Hard Stop Condition:** If `Architecture.md` does not exist, halt execution and output:
    > "Awaiting system blueprints. `Architecture.md` was not found. Please provide details on:
    > 1. Your core framework stack, target database, and preferred test runner.
    > 2. Code formatting rules (e.g., space indentation, strict typing rules).
    > 3. Your preferred architectural patterns (e.g., monolithic layers, microservices, specific folder structures)."

* **Step 4 - Database Schema (`Schema.md` Check):** Verify that `Schema.md` exists at the root.
  * This file must define the exact schema of the database that will be used for the project, directly informing the `Build.md`.
  * **Hard Stop Condition:** If it does not exist, ask the user for context to create it.

* **Step 5 - Master Execution Plan (`Build.md` Check):** Verify that `Build.md` exists at the root.
  * Contains a granular, chronological, step-by-step technical plan to construct the project. Every individual step must feature a detailed implementation definition alongside dedicated verification checks. 
  * **Hard Stop Condition:** If `Build.md` does not exist, halt execution and output:
    > "Awaiting master engineering plan. Please provide or allow me to generate a `Build.md` file detailing the step-by-step plan, detailed execution sub-steps, and verification criteria for this project."

* **Step 6 - Progress Ledger Synchronization (`Progress.md` Update Loop):** Track execution metrics cleanly.
  * Must contain completely separate tracking tables/blocks for **Frontend Tasks** and **Backend Tasks**, mapped to the `Build.md` milestones.
  * **Imperative Constraint:** Always update this ledger whenever executing a step and instantly execute the `/refresh` tool command to synchronize memory state.

* **Step 7 - Imperative Surgical Modification:** When modifying code base structures, perform targeted modifications to single blocks of lines. Do not blindly overwrite entire functional scripts.

* **Step 8 - Contextual Memory Sync (`memorycontext.md` Check):** Maintain an unbroken chain of historical and situational awareness.
  * The `memorycontext.md` file acts as a living operational log containing: current context of the work, what was previously accomplished, immediate next objectives, detailed records of where executions failed, where they succeeded, alternative approaches already attempted, and finalized tasks.
  * **Imperative Constraint:** Always update this document before writing, building, or generating any new code.

## 3. Antigravity Asynchronous Subagents (Multi-Agent Directory Framework)
# Utilize the `.agents/agents/` workspace structure to delegate parallel tasks asynchronously without blocking the main terminal view.

* **The Head Project Manager (`project-manager`):** Acts as the strict planner and central orchestrator. Refuses to write application syntax directly; exclusively delegates tasks, evaluates blueprints, and writes progress summaries.
* **The QA & Browser Operator (`qa-operator`):** Drives automated UI verification loops via headless browser integration.
* **The Continuous Test Runner (`test-runner`):** Sandbox test-suite watchdog handling active local debugging loops and test executions.
* **The Documentation Researcher (`deep-researcher`):** Scrapes web syntax, ingests dense documentation trees, and parses package registries.
* **The Code Auditor & Security Reviewer (`security-auditor`):** Defensive guardrail evaluating static code complexity, style consistency, and localized schema hooks.

---

## 4. Automation & Verification Loops (Playwright MCP Integration)
# Replicate deterministic quality metrics via active workspace extensions.

* **Pre-Commit Verification:** Every code alteration must be followed by an internal verification check. Trigger the local development environment to confirm zero runtime degradation.
* **Playwright MCP Server (`@playwright/mcp`):** Use the Playwright Model Context Protocol to strictly read the structured DOM Accessibility Tree. Do not guess visual screen coordinates or use brittle screenshots. Validate clicks, inputs, and routing paths structurally.
* **Error Log Debugging Process:** If a local runtime error occurs, offload parsing to the `test-runner` subagent to perform micro-surgical line replacements.

---

## 5. Core Safety Rules & Guardrails (Terminal Sandbox Restrictions)
# High-priority operational safety instructions leveraging Antigravity's built-in OS protection.

* **Antigravity Terminal Sandbox Enforcement:** All executed background loops and subagent actions must strictly run inside the native built-in isolation mechanism (`nsjail` on Linux, `sandbox-exec` on macOS) to prevent autonomous scripts from accidentally trashing the host computer system state.
* **Data Loss Prevention:** Never execute destructive file operations, forced git branch resets, or database drops without explicitly prompting the human user for manual approval.
* **Environment Isolation:** Do not read, write, or alter global computer environment variables.
* **Automated Rollbacks:** If an automated verification loop fails three consecutive times due to compilation faults, invoke the `/restore` mechanism to revert to the last functional workspace checkpoint and ask the user for architectural clarity.
* **Git Push Confirmation Guardrail:** If a project is connected to GitHub or is deployed, the agent must **always** ask the user if local changes should be pushed to the remote cloud branch or remain local-only for the time being, preventing excessive pushes for minor edits.
